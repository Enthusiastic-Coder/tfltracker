  <p>This app is a 'Viewer' to data that is served by <a href="https://api.tfl.gov.uk/">London UK TFL</a>.</p>
  <br>

    <p><b>NB</b> Vehicle (Train/Bus/Tram etc) position is not based on actual position information as this is not available from TFL but is
           derived or estimated by looking at times (in minutes) left to arrive to a station/bus stop.</p>

    <p>DLR data is incomplete/missing compared to the other lines.</p>
    <p>Consequently DLR position information is inaccurate.</p>
    <br>
  <p>Map rendered from custom processed data from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">Open Street Map</a></p>
